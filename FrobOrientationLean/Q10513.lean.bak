We have successfully formalized and proved the Dream Theorem for the prime $q = 10513$.

The main results are:
- `artin_property_10513`: The Artin map on the ring of integers corresponds to the Frobenius automorphism.
- `final_result_10513`: The Dream Theorem, which characterizes the action of the Frobenius automorphism on the periods $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ in terms of the character values $c(N) \pmod{10513}$.

The proof follows the structure of the reference proofs, defining the field $K = \mathbb{Q}(\zeta_{10513})$, the ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_K$, the periods $\eta_0, \eta_1, \eta_2$, and the modified periods $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$. We established the action of the Galois group on these periods and used the Artin property to relate the Frobenius element to the Galois automorphisms.

All proofs are complete with no `sorry`s.

We have successfully proved the Dream Theorem for the prime $q = 1567$.
The proof follows the structure of prior proofs for $q = 877, 937, 1063, 1129$.
We defined the field $K = \mathbb{Q}(\zeta_{1567})$, the ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_K$, and the Gaussian periods $\eta_0, \eta_1, \eta_2$.
We defined the period differences $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ with the appropriate sign convention.
We established the algebraic relations between $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ using the period equation and computation.
We proved the Artin property for the extension $K/\mathbb{Q}$.
We characterized the cosets $C_1, C_2$ using the cubic character $\chi$.
Finally, we proved `final_result_1567`, which states that for a prime $N \neq 1567$, the Frobenius action on $\alpha$ is determined by the value of the cubic character $\chi(N)$.

We define the cyclotomic field $K = \mathbb{Q}(\zeta_{1129})$, the ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_K$, and the Gaussian periods $\eta_0, \eta_1, \eta_2$. We define the period differences $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ with the correct sign convention. We prove the Artin property for $\mathcal{O}_K$ and use it to prove the Dream Theorem for $q = 1129$, which relates the Frobenius action on $\alpha$ to the cubic character $c(N)$. The proof assumes the period equation for $\alpha$ as requested.

Proof of the Dream Theorem for q = 1063.

We define the cyclotomic field K = Q(zeta_1063), the ring of integers Ok, and the Gaussian periods.
We identify a generator g = 6 such that the cubic character c(g) = s2 = 719.
We define the roots alpha, beta, gamma using this generator and the standard sign convention.
We prove the Artin property for the extension.
We prove the global permutation of roots under the Galois group.
Finally, we prove the Dream Theorem:
If c(N) = s1, then alpha^N = gamma mod P.
If c(N) = s2, then alpha^N = beta mod P.
This relies on the period equation alpha^3 = 1063*alpha + 1063, which is added as a hypothesis.

Proof of the Dream Theorem for q = 937.

We define the cyclotomic field K = Q(zeta_937), its ring of integers Ok, and the Gaussian periods.
We identify a generator g = 7 for which the cubic character values match the s1/s2 definitions.
We prove the Artin property for the extension K/Q.
We prove the main theorem `dream_theorem_937` which states that for a prime N != 937:
- If c(N) = s1, then alpha^N = gamma mod P.
- If c(N) = s2, then alpha^N = beta mod P.
This assumes the period equation `alpha^3 = 937*alpha + 937`.

We define the cyclotomic field K for q = 877 and the Gaussian periods. We prove the Dream Theorem for q = 877, which states that the Frobenius automorphism maps the period difference α to β or γ depending on the cubic character of the prime N modulo 877. The proof relies on the Artin property of the Frobenius map and the explicit calculation of the Galois action on the periods.

We defined the constants s1, s2, and the value c(N). We proved lemmas characterizing the cosets C1 and C2 in terms of the 12th power residue symbol (which relates to c(N)). Finally, we proved the main theorem `final_result` which establishes the Frobenius action on alpha (i.e., alpha^N) in terms of beta and gamma, depending on the value of c(N). The proof utilizes the `explicit_frobenius` theorem and the algebraic relations between alpha, beta, and gamma.

This module formalizes the proof of the Frobenius Orientation conjecture for q=37.
It defines the cyclotomic field K = Q(zeta_37), the Gaussian periods, and the cubic roots.
It proves the cyclic algebraic relations between these roots and establishes the global Galois action.
It descends to the residue field modulo a prime P lying over N != 37, proving the Artin property.
Finally, it derives the explicit Frobenius action on the reduction of alpha modulo P.
